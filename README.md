# Checkers minmax with alpha beta pruning

### Author(s): Dagobert Kluczny, Jan Fronczek

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a classic 8x8 Checkers game. The project focuses on creating a clean graphical interface using Pygame and developing an advanced AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and Zobrist hashing.

## Features/Functionalities
Key points of what exactly users can do or achieve from our repository:
* **Graphical Interface:** Clean visualization of the board, pieces, and game status using `pygame`.
* **Advanced AI:** Implementation of Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning and Zobrist Hashing for memory optimization.
* **Configurable Heuristics:** Multiple AI strategies including Aggressive Doubling, Sum & Backline, and Material Advantage.
* **Difficulty Levels:** Adjustable search depths (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* **Console Mode:** Separate mode for algorithm simulation and testing.

## Installation & Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/Dagbert1337/checkers-minmax-ab-pruning.git
   cd checkers-minmax-ab-pruning

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (Recommended)
   `python -m venv venv`
   `source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Play GUI Mode**
   Run the graphical interface to play against the AI:
   `python3 ui.py`

   * **Select Difficulty:** Press 1 (Easy), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Hard).
   * **Side Selection:** By default, you play as White (Bottom). To play as Black, change 'w' to 'b' in line 308 of `ui.py`.

2. **Run Simulation**
   Run the console-based engine for Bot vs. Bot or text-based Human vs. Bot games:
   `python3 simulation.py`

3. **Analyze/Benchmark AI**
   Run the experimental tournament script to benchmark different heuristics against each other:
   Uncomment run_experiment() in arena.py main block first
   `python3 arena.py`

   This generates a `statistics.json` file containing win/loss rates and average game lengths.

## Examples

**Input System**
This game uses a text-based input system for precision within the GUI. The board uses English Draughts notation (0-31 indexing).

To move a piece, type your move in the `start.end` format and press Enter:

* **Standard Move:** To move from square 9 to 13:
    9.13

* **Attacking Move:** To jump from 18 to 14 (capturing a piece):
    18.14
    (Note: Enter the target square, not the square after the target).

## Additional Resources
* **Heuristics Explained:**
    * `sum_score`: Material advantage (White pieces - Black pieces).
    * `sum_and_backline`: Material score + bonuses for guarding the "King's row".
    * `sum_and_doubling`: Material score + rewards for diagonal adjacency (defensive walls).
    * `doubling_aggresive`: Balances defensive structure with aggressive forward movement.
* **Rules:** Mandatory jumps are enforced. If a capture is available, the game rejects non-capturing moves.
